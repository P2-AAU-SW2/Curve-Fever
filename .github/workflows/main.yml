    # Autotag will look for the package.json file in in this location.
    package_root: # optional, default is ./
    # By default, package.json uses semantic versioning, such as "1.0.0". A prefix can be used to add text before the tag name. For example, if tag_prefx is set to "v", then the tag would be labeled as "v1.0.0".
    tag_prefix: # optional
    # Text which is applied to the end of the tag.
    tag_suffix: # optional
    # This is the annotated commit message associated with the tag. By default, a changelog will be generated from the commits between the latest tag and the new tag (HEAD). This will override that with a hard-coded message.
    tag_message: # optional
    # A string denoting changelog format. Supports `{{message}}`, {{messageHeadline}}, `{{author}}` and `{{sha}}`. Defaults to `**1) {{message}}** {{author}}
(SHA: {{sha}})
` Only used when tag_message is empty.
    changelog_structure: # optional
    # Explicitly set the version here instead of automatically detecting from `package.json`. Useful for non-JavaScript projects where version may be output by a previous action.
    version: # optional
